# React Router v6 Nested Routes Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem involves a nested route that fails to render correctly, preventing the ContactForm component from appearing when navigating to '/contact/form'.  The solution involves correctly setting up nested routes using the `<Route>` and `<Outlet>` components within the parent route.
